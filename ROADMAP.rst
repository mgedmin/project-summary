Roadmap
=======

Hahahahahahahaha.  Haaaahahahaha.  Ha.  Haha.  Ha.

Anyway, here's a handful of ideas I might be bothered to implement someday:

- Column showing the number of open GitHub issues
- Column showing the number of open GitHub pull requests
- Column showing Python version compatibility (2.6 2.7 3.2 3.3 3.4 PyPy)
- Column showing Jenkins build statuses (Linux/Windows)
- Last updated timestamp in the footer, maybe?
