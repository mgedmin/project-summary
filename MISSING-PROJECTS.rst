Missing projects
================

I've access to a bazillion PyPI projects because I'm a Zope Foundation
committer.  Here are the ones where I'm the only maintainer, which aren't
already listed on http://projects.gedmin.as:

- gtkeggdeps

There's also Dozer, where I'm the only active maintainer (ha! active!).  It's a
bit of a special case (BitBucket, not GitHub).
